# Linked Lists [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.

### [Singly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list)
* Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. 
* Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.
